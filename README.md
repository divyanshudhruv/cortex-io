# üß© MCP Starter Cortex-IO

Welcome to the MCP Starter HKTHN repository! This project is a collection of powerful, ready-to-use Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers for Puch AI, each focused on a unique productivity or information task. All logic and programming for each service is kept in a single Python file‚Äîno extra files needed for core functionality.

## üì¶ About This Repository

This repository is designed for rapid prototyping and deployment of MCP servers for Puch AI. Each MCP service ("puchkeep", "puchmail", "puchgames", "puchmeds", "puchscan", "puchtasks", "puchchat") is implemented in a single, self-contained Python file. This approach makes it easy to:

- Understand and modify each service
- Deploy or test any service independently
- Avoid boilerplate and unnecessary files

> **All logic, tool registration, and server code for each MCP is in one file. No extra files are needed!**

## üöÄ MCP Services in This Repo

| Service   | File                     | Description                                                                                        |
| --------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| PuchKeep  | `puchkeep/puchkeep.py`   | Personal memory vault: save, list, retrieve, delete, and manage memories with emoji-rich feedback. |
| PuchMail  | `puchmail/puchmail.py`   | Secure email sending and management via WhatsApp/Puch AI, with multi-provider support.             |
| PuchGame  | `puchgames/anagram.py`   | Daily anagram word game: sign up, log in, get words, submit guesses, and view leaderboards.        |
| PuchMeds  | `puchmeds/puchmeds.py`   | AI-powered medicine info: get side effects, prevention, and posture tips for any medicine.         |
| PuchScan  | `puchscan/puchscan.py`   | Receipt/image processor: crop, enhance, and return PDFs of receipts via WhatsApp/Puch AI.          |
| PuchTasks | `puchtasks/puchtasks.py` | Google Keep notes manager: add, list, and delete notes with Google OAuth and Supabase.             |
| PuchChat  | `puchchat/puchchat.py`   | Real-time chat: connect, send, and fetch messages, see connected users, all in one file.           |

Each file contains:

- All tool definitions (with `@mcp.tool`)
- Server setup and authentication
- All business logic and data handling
- Rich, emoji-friendly user feedback

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use

1. **Clone this repo**
2. **Install dependencies** (see each service's `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`)
3. **Set up your `.env` file** with the required secrets (see each service's comments)
4. **Run any MCP server**:
   ```bash
   python puchkeep/puchkeep.py
   # or
   python puchmail/puchmail.py
   # ...etc
   ```
5. **Expose your server** (e.g., with ngrok) for Puch AI to connect

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Service Descriptions

- **PuchKeep**: Save, list, retrieve, delete, and rename memories. Use multiple memories at once and save lists to text files. All in one file.
- **PuchMail**: Connect mail accounts, send emails, and manage sessions. Multi-provider support, all logic in one file.
- **PuchGame**: Play daily anagram games, submit guesses, and view leaderboards. All game logic in one file.
- **PuchMeds**: Get real-time, AI-powered medicine info (side effects, prevention, posture). All logic in one file.
- **PuchScan**: Process receipts/images, crop and enhance, return PDFs. All logic in one file.
- **PuchTasks**: Manage Google Keep notes (add, list, delete) with Google OAuth. All logic in one file.
- **PuchChat**: Real-time chat with connect/send/fetch/connected-users. All logic in one file.

## ‚ú® Why This Approach?

- **Simplicity**: Each service is a single file‚Äîeasy to read, debug, and deploy.
- **Portability**: Copy any file to a new project and you have a working MCP server.
- **No Boilerplate**: No extra folders or files for core logic‚Äîjust one file per service.
- **AI Generated Comments**: Each file includes detailed comments generated by AI to explain the code and its purpose.
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Quickly test and deploy new MCP servers without complex setups.
